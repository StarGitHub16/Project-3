# Project-3

This Webiste is intended to be used for people to list their gifts they want
for the holiday season and they'll have the ability to order them by least 
to greatest as well.

There is a contact page which is intended to allow for the user to be able
to be emailed the final product of the list. It is currently not doing that as of current.

This is a website that I have designed this time using ReactJS and me testing
the waters with all that. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But is mainly
created using React and includes dependencies such as React Router.

Some future implementations could be:

1) Creating a backend to store data, so that the contact feature becomes more relevant

2) Adding more Styling and Optimazation for Mobile Devices.

3) Adding more Features such as way to maybe drag and drop the gifts as opposed
to just hitting an arrow button.
